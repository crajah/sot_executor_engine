# Reflex

Reflex is a library for real-time analytics, prediction and personalisation built of state-of-the-art deep learning and artificial intelligence libraries. 

True Real Time. Every system we build executes in under 100 milliseconds.

Analytics (in Real Time). Our platform captures unstructured (image and text) and event stream data, transforms it, and derives insight from it. (e.g. Customer Preference, Product Performance)

Prediction (in Real Time). Our platform can navigate through 1000s of scenarios, make a prediction, take a decision and perform an action in real-time. (e.g. Churn Prediction, Next Best Action, Ad Targeting) 

Personalisation (in Real Time). Learning from individuals constantly at a mind-bending rate, our platform begins to understand true desire and innate preferences of individuals making it possible for Hyper-Segmentation, One-to-One personalisation and Recommendations.
